Welcome to ROUTE RUSH!

ROUTE RUSH is a strategy game that challenges you to find the shortest way between two points in a complex maze filled with obstacles and challenges. To ensure that you have a great experience, please read the following instructions carefully:

Getting Started:
  The game can be played on any computer as long as Python3 is installed. By clicking on the buttons, you can enter in any difficult or level you want.

Game Objective:
  The goal of the game is to find the shortest path between start-end points in a complex maze. You will encounter various obstacles and challenges, such as slopes and holes, which will require you to think strategically and plan your moves carefully.

Controls:
- By using the buttons on the screen you can freely control your character to reach the position you want. 
- Moreover, you are even able to use your keyboard to move your character. Specifically:
    + W, A, S, D: to move up, left, down and right
    + Q, E, C, Z: to move up-left, up-right, down-right and down-left
- The game is also set up the "return" button with whom you can correct your mistake of moving

Gameplay:
  As you progress through the game, you will encounter various types of terrain, such as flat lands, slopes and holes. 
   - Flat lands: allow you to move with normal speed and pass a square with only 1 "distance". 
   - Slopes: slow you down so that you need to travel 2 "distance" to pass them.
   - Holes: are deep and scary, and you cannot enter this area.

Tips:
- Pay attention to the obstacles and terrain in each level.
- Plan your moves carefully to avoid obstacles and find the shortest path.
- Don't forget to use the "return" button to correct your mistakes.
- Remember that a straight path is not necessarily the shortest.

Saving your progress:
  Your progress will be automatically saved as you play, so you can pick up where you left off if you need to take a break or come back to the game later.

The game still has numerous interesting things. Enjoy the challenge!
